# Go-Getter

Go-Getter is a simple and intuitive to-do list app built using ReactJS. This app is built as a part of my learning journey in ReactJS. 
The development of this app aims to test my understanding on basic concepts of ReactJS.

As I progress, I might or I might not improve this project more in the future by adding more features and probably back-end.
But still feel free to review this project and any **feedback** would be greatly appreciated.

## Features

- Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks,
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete,
- Categorize tasks with **lists**,
- By default, tasks may be added to **Inbox**. So that you may immediately get them out of your head and come back to organize them later.
